Cases and Stuff for Watchy

## Cases
1. Slim 
  This is the original case from [SQFMI's watchy-cases](https://github.com/sqfmi/watchy-cases). Had some errors slicing the file, hence rebuilt it as Slim V2 
2. Slim V2
  Insipred by the Slim case, designed for use with NATO straps
3. Slim V3
  " Designed for a Watchy with the watch strap loops cut off from the PCB.
  
## All cases moving forward will be for Watchy with the loops cut off
  
## Upcoming cases
- Case designed for use with the straps in the starter kit (spring bar style)
  The NATO strap adds a bit of thickness since it goes under the case. For an already chonky case, that's not good. The spring bar style strap mounting would fix that
