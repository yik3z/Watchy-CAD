# Touchscreen Test Code

Contains the first version of the library used to interface with the FT6336U touch IC. The library is working but will not be updated anymore (as of 21 Mar 2023).

Moving forward, developments are done in Watchy-CODE, currently under the `touchscreen_mod` branch (eventually to me merged with `main`).
